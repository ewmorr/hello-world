# hello-world

Hello!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher studying how climate change affects fungi and bacteria in soil â€“ what they do, where they occur, and why. Among other things I do at work, I often use existing bioinformatics tools, Perl, and R to process and analyze sequence data from various projects.
